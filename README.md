# docgen

docgen is a container that can be used to generate documents. It is based on
the official Ubuntu 22.04 image. Additionally some packages that are useful
when generating documents are installed, e.g.:

- cmake
- makce
- pandoc
- plantuml

Additionally texlive is installed together with some (latex) packages that were
needed in the past. The list might grow over time whenever a new project
requires some new packages.
